###Background
In today’s dynamic and ever changing world, it is imperative for professionals across all fields of work to keep up with the social and political happenings. However, very often technical professionals from fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, architecture, science, and more, are relatively uninformed about the political landscape both locally and globally. This leads to an uninformed electorate who go on to elect demagogues and dictatorial politicians, as we have seen in recent years. A society that doesn’t allow the free percolation of information between all it’s various communities and components such as politics, entertainment, sports, and technology, is a recipe for disaster, and we must strive to correct this.  Technical professional spend most of their time in front of their computers. \*nix users, such as server-side engineers, data scientists, analysts, across a plethora of fields, begin and end their day behind their terminal shells. Therefore, *we must bring all the **relevant news** of the day in a readable, easy to access and intelligent format **right into the users terminal.***

With this problem statement in mind, we set out to develop **news.sh - *Your one stop shop for the latest news, right from your terminal!*** 
* A simple shell script that uses the news-api to deliver the top news articles of the day right to your terminal window. 
* It is easy to read, and sorted along user defined parameters such as - top, popular, latest. 
* Moreover, the user can customise the application with their preferred news sources, and view articles and sources categorised by language, country and news categories such as - business, entertainment, gaming, general, music, politics, science-and-nature, sport, technology.
